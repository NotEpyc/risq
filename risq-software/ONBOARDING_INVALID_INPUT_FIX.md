# Onboarding "Invalid Input" Error Fix

## Problem
When clicking "Complete Setup" in the onboarding flow, the backend returns an "invalid input" error.

## Root Causes Identified and Fixed

### 1. Team Size Type Mismatch
- **Problem**: `_teamSize` was an `int` but backend expects a string range
- **Solution**: Added `_getTeamSizeRange()` method to convert int to appropriate string ranges:
  - `1` → `"1"`
  - `2-5` → `"1-5"`
  - `6-10` → `"6-10"`
  - `11-20` → `"11-20"`
  - `21-50` → `"21-50"`
  - `50+` → `"50+"`

### 2. Type Casting Issues in Debug Code
- **Problem**: `payload["description"]` was treated as `Object` type in debug code, causing compilation errors
- **Solution**: Added proper type casting: `final description = payload["description"] as String;`

### 3. Enhanced Validation
- Added comprehensive payload validation before submission
- Added type checking for all numeric fields
- Added array validation for revenue streams and technology stack
- Added JSON encoding validation to catch serialization issues early

## Changes Made

### `lib/screens/pages/onboarding_page.dart`
1. **Added `_getTeamSizeRange()` method** - converts team size integer to string range
2. **Updated payload construction** - uses `_getTeamSizeRange(_teamSize)` instead of raw `_teamSize`
3. **Enhanced debugging** - improved type checking and validation output
4. **Added numeric field validation** - ensures all financial fields are proper numbers
5. **Added JSON encoding test** - validates payload can be serialized before API call

## Testing
- Created `test_team_size.dart` to validate team size conversion logic
- Added comprehensive debugging output to trace payload construction
- Added validation for empty required fields and type mismatches

## Expected Result
- Team size is now sent as a string range instead of raw integer
- All type casting issues are resolved
- Better error messages if validation fails
- No more "invalid input" errors from backend

## Usage
The onboarding form now properly validates and formats all data before submission. If any validation fails, specific error messages will guide the user to fix the issues.
