# Authentication Error Fix

## Problem Identified

The "Authentication error. Please try again" issue in the onboarding page was caused by two main problems:

### 1. Token Extraction Issue

**Problem**: The backend API response structure was nested, but the AuthService was expecting a flat structure.

**Backend Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User created successfully",
  "data": {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
    "user": { "id": "...", "email": "...", "name": "..." }
  }
}
```

**Fix Applied**: Updated AuthService to extract token from nested structure:
```dart
// Before
final token = responseData['token'];

// After  
final token = responseData['data']?['token'] ?? responseData['token'];
```

### 2. Date Format Issue

**Problem**: The backend was rejecting ISO 8601 datetime format for `founded_date`.

**Backend Error**: 
```
"invalid founded date format: parsing time \"2025-06-28T10:53:15.422838\": extra text: \"T10:53:15.422838\""
```

**Fix Applied**: Changed date format to simple YYYY-MM-DD:
```dart
// Before
"founded_date": DateTime.now().toIso8601String(),

// After
"founded_date": DateTime.now().toUtc().toIso8601String().split('T')[0],
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `lib/services/auth_service.dart`
- Fixed token extraction for both login and signup methods
- Added fallback to handle both nested and flat response structures

### 2. `lib/screens/pages/onboarding_page.dart` 
- Fixed date format for founded_date field
- Enhanced debugging and error handling
- Added fallback token mechanism

### 3. `lib/screens/login/signup_page.dart`
- Added token verification debugging
- Pass token as fallback parameter to onboarding

### 4. `lib/screens/login/signin_page.dart`
- Pass token as fallback parameter to onboarding

## Test Results

After fixes, the standalone authentication test shows:

```
✅ SUCCESS: Authentication is working correctly!
```

- Token extraction: ✅ Working
- Token storage: ✅ Working  
- API authentication: ✅ Working
- Startup onboarding: ✅ Working

## Current Status

The authentication error should now be resolved. The app will:

1. ✅ Properly extract JWT tokens from login/signup responses
2. ✅ Store tokens correctly in SharedPreferences  
3. ✅ Use correct date format for backend API
4. ✅ Provide fallback mechanisms for token issues
5. ✅ Include comprehensive error handling and debugging

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix:

1. **Signup/Login**: Should complete successfully with token storage
2. **Onboarding**: "Complete Setup" should work without authentication errors
3. **Console Logs**: Should show "Token available: Yes" and successful API calls

## Debug Tools Available

If issues persist, you can use:

1. **AuthDebugWidget**: Real-time authentication status checking
2. **Console Logs**: Detailed authentication flow logging  
3. **Standalone Test**: `dart run test_auth.dart` for backend verification

The authentication system is now robust and should handle the JWT token flow correctly throughout the app.
