# Education Feature Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a multi-education entry system in the onboarding form, replacing the single text field with a dynamic list of education entries.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Education List
- Users can add multiple education entries
- Each education entry contains:
  - Degree/Qualification (required for first entry)
  - Institution (required for first entry)
  - Graduation Year (required for first entry, validated for realistic years)

### 2. Add/Remove Functionality
- "Add Education" button to add new entries
- Remove button (red circle icon) for each entry except when only one remains
- Proper controller disposal when removing entries

### 3. UI Design
- Each education entry is contained in a styled card with:
  - Semi-transparent black background
  - White border with opacity
  - Clear labeling ("Education 1", "Education 2", etc.)
  - Consistent styling with the rest of the app

### 4. Validation
- First education entry is required (degree, institution, and graduation year)
- Additional entries are optional but validated if filled
- Graduation year validation (1950 to current year + 10)

### 5. JSON Integration
- Education data is properly formatted for the JSON payload
- Converts list of education objects to array format
- Filters out empty education entries
- Maintains compatibility with the existing JSON schema

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
```dart
List<Map<String, dynamic>> _educations = [];
```

Each education entry contains TextEditingController objects for:
- `degree`: TextEditingController
- `institution`: TextEditingController  
- `graduation_year`: TextEditingController

### Key Functions
- `_addEducation()`: Adds a new education entry with fresh controllers
- `_removeEducation(int index)`: Removes education entry and disposes controllers
- Proper initialization in `initState()` with one default entry
- Complete disposal in `dispose()` method

### JSON Output Format
```json
"education": [
  {
    "degree": "Bachelor of Computer Science",
    "institution": "MIT", 
    "graduation_year": "2020"
  },
  {
    "degree": "Master of Business Administration",
    "institution": "Stanford University",
    "graduation_year": "2022"
  }
]
```

## Files Modified
- `lib/screens/pages/onboarding_page.dart`: Main implementation file

## Validation Results
- ✅ Code compiles without errors
- ✅ Flutter analyze passes (only deprecation warnings, no critical issues)
- ✅ All TextEditingController objects properly managed
- ✅ UI follows app's design patterns
- ✅ JSON payload structure matches requirements

## Usage
1. Users start with one education entry
2. Fill in degree, institution, and graduation year  
3. Click "Add Education" to add more entries
4. Click the red remove icon to delete entries (minimum one required)
5. Data is automatically included in the JSON payload when form is submitted

The education feature is now fully functional and integrated with the existing onboarding flow.
